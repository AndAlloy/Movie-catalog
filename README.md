# movie.catalog
This is demo Spring Framework project for my educational purposes.

It uses Spring Security, Hibernate, Freemarker, JPA/JDBC and so on.

The project itself is a movie catalog that uses IMDB API to collect information about different titles. Frontend made with Freemarker and CSS. 

In future I wanted to make a REST application to learn and work with React.
